I had a great weekend. On Friday afternoon, I finished work at 5 PM. I went home and took a shower. Then I went to see a couple of my friends at a bar downtown. 

We had a couple of beers and a nice talk. 

Tom told us about his new job, and Jim told us about his new girlfriend. After a while, we went to a restaurant and had pizza. I went to bed late that night, but I was very happy.

On Saturday morning I went running in the park. I ran 5 kilometers, and then came home.

After that, I met my girlfriend for lunch. We went to a Thai restaurant near my house. I love Thai food!

I spent the evening with my girlfriend, watching TV on the sofa.

The next day, I got up and caught the train to my parents’ town. I usually go to see my parents on Sundays, at least twice a month.

My mom usually makes a roast, and we go for a walk in the park or in the country after lunch.

This weekend was a bit different, though. My parents took me out for a nice lunch, because it was my birthday. After lunch, we took a walk (as usual) and then I caught the train back to London.

Now it’s Monday and I’m back at work, but I’ve got big plans for next weekend!

Shawn’s family is not very big. His mother and father live in a flat in London. His father works in an insurance company, and his mother is a nurse. Shawn shares a flat with two friends and works in a restaurant. He has two sisters, Lucy and Millie, who live together in Southampton.

Shawn has a girlfriend, and Lucy has a boyfriend, but Millie is single.

Shawn’s girlfriend’s name is Maria, and she’s Italian. He’s in love with her, and with her dog. He loves going for a walk with Maria and her dog.

At weekends, Lucy and Millie come to London and the whole family has lunch together. Sometimes one of their aunts or uncles come, too.

Shawn’s grandparents are very old, and they live in a small cottage in Plymouth. They’re his mother’s parents. His father’s parents died years ago. Shawn’s grandparents are retired, and spend most of their time gardening, walking and having tea with their friends.

A few times a year, Shawn goes to spend some time with his grandparents. His grandmother makes excellent fruit pies. Sometimes, his cousins come, too, and they all have a great time.
